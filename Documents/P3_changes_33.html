			<h2>Changes to individual pages</h2>

			<h3> Changes to contact.html </h3>
			<p><i>Handled by: Adrian (+ style by Cathrine).</i><br>This page has for the most part followed the plan. Only thing that has been added is a form where you can "Bli en kråke".
				With this follows a form where you can submit your name, telephone number, e-mail adress and a text put in a textbox.
				The social media part has been added as planned and coded as a non-styled list.
			</p>

			<h3> Changes to gallery.html </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Cathrine.</i><br>We decided to have the image carousel full width of the browser, since this looks better. We also removed the "next" and "previous" buttons on the side of the images, and the descripton, which gives the carousel a cleaner look. Instead we chose to make the images change on a timer and added small clickable "dots" under the carousel so it is possible for the user to change the images without waiting. For the images below the carousel, we made it possible for the images to have a different height in the columns instead of same sized pictures. This again gives the page a clean and nice look, and we avoid having to size the images up or down in an unnatural way. We also made the description of the smaller images show on hover, another way to make the design cleaner. </p>

			<h3> Changes to index.html </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Joakim.</i><br> No real changes from P2 to remark here. </p>

			<h3> Changes to about_styret.html </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Adrian and Cathrine (+ images and text by Joakim)</i><br> On this page we have followed our initial plan quite closely; we have round images of the board members and their names below. However, we have changed some of the functions of the page. Below the member names, the title of their position in the board are stated and when the user hovers over an image, it changes to a different one. For this functionality we have used JavaScript to avoid too much css, since there are in total nine different images that will change to nine other different images on hover. </p>

			<h3> Changes to blog.html </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Henning</i><br> Here, we did not change much from the plan. </p>

			<h3> Changes to gallery.html </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Cathrine (+ images and text by Joakim)</i><br> We decided to have the image carousel full width of the browser, since this looks better.

We also made the description of the smaller images show on hover, another way to make the design cleaner. </p>

			<h3> Changes to songs.html </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Joakim.</i><br> Instead of having only one lyric-box be visible at a time (with any already open lyric-box closing whenever you opened a new one, as per the design doc), we instead opted to let the user keep several songs open.
			The idea behind this was simply out of practicality; to let Crows have their specific songs open for a given performance, so the can scroll between the ones they need then and there, rather than having to open them each progressively.
			Another small change not specified in design: longer songs will now have their lyrics split into two columns (responsively: this only happens on screens wider than 1000px). The genuine songbook for Kråkeluren is formatted in two columns - it only made sense to do it that way. </p>

			<h3> Changes to about.html </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Cathrine</i><br> The about Kråkeluren page does not have many changes from the initial plan either. The only thing we added was a description over the big image that is shown on hover. We also made this image 100% width of the browser and let the header be below instead of above. </p>

			<h3> Changes to shop.html </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Cathrine (+ images and text by Joakim)</i><br> This page has almost the same design as the initial plan, but we have changed and added a few things. Firstly; since we only had three items to display in the show, we made the left column have one item and the right column have two items, but keeping the height of the two column the same. We made sure the one item on the left had more text to make it look natural. Having the same heigth of the columns makes the page look a lot better. Secondly; we added another JavaScript-functionality (shop.js). We had comments from our testing telling us that it would be nice to have a way of "ordering" items on the page. Therfore we created buttons to add items to cart, and functions to see the cart and submit order using an email address. Of course the order is not actually submitted, since this is not in our curriculum. </p>

			<h3> Changes to calendar.html </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: XXX</i><br> Changey stuff. </p>

			<h3> Changes to style.css </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Everyone</i><br> As planned in P2, the styling was a very collaborative effort with the goal to give the site a coherent aesthetic. A note is that we used colors from the Kråkeluren logo instead of the example-colors in our plan. </p>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Cathrine</i><br> In our initial plan we had the different "boxes" (for example the blog-posts) and smaller images with a background color and nothing else, but decided to add some shadow to them which creates a less "flat" web page and improves the design. </p>

				<h2> Other changes </h2>

				<h3> Changes to the navbar </h3>
				<p> <i>Handled by: Martin</i><br>
					The navbar is a dynamic navbar, which shrinks when the user scrolls down a certain amount of pixels. The whole navbar, with its corresponding logo will shrink to a predetermined size. This is accomplished by using JavaScript. The responsivety of the navbar is made so that when the browser window is less than 750 pixels, the logo shrinks and the navbar-menu is then changed to one single button, which when clicked will open a dropdown menu containing the navbar. The menu buttons are all clickable, and will direct to the corresponding webpage. When on an webpage, the button for the corresponding site the user is on, will be lit up in a blue color, in order to indicate which site is currently active. The buttons will also get a faint gray background when hovered over.
				</p>

				<h3> Changes to the footer </h3>
				<p> <i>Handled by: Martin</i><br>
					In the footer there is now 4 buttons; linking to each of their social medias: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat. These buttons are clickable, and will also change color to their respective color schemes when hovered over.
					Below this, there's a small section with our group name on.

		<h2> Completion of requirements </h2>
			<h3> Image carousel (gallery.js) </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Cathrine</i><br> I used two tutorials from <i>w3schools</i> as inspiration (links are in the comments of gallery.js) and created a image carousel that changes images on a timer (5 seconds apart), with the possibility of clicking "dots" to change the image as well. The comments in the file explains quite thoroughly what happens and how the carousel works. I also added a small animation when the images change, but this is with CSS. </p>

			<h3> Image transition (about_styret.js) </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Cathrine</i><br> This code is used to change the images of the board members on the about_styret.html page on hover. First I loop through the nine (number of board members) empty divs that are above the names and text, and add different background images to these. We named the different jpg-files similarly (only a different number at the end) which made this loop easier and shorter to write than to manually set the background images. Then I used the functions "onmouseover" and "onmouseout" to decide in JS what will happen when the user moves the cursor over the image and off again. I defined two functions that changes the image depending on what you do, and these have a number-argument to decide which of the jpg-files to set as background image. Again, this is easier than to write nine different hover-codes in CSS. </p>

			<h3> Order items (shop.js) </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Cathrine</i><br> This code was as mentioned not in our inital plan, but we added it to make the website even more user friendly and interactive. The code is quite long, but a big part of it is getting the elements from the shop.html-file and changing the display. This functionality allows the user to add items to a cart and "order" them, see the section about shop.html above. I created a layout where the user would have to click "add to cart" on items to then display the cart, the price and two buttons. These buttons lets the user clear the cart or go to "ordering". By choosing the last one, an input field is displayed where the user have to enter their email address before "ordering". Here I also used email validation, which I had to do using JS instead of the "required" attribute, since I have functions on the "order" button that creates a problem in HTML forms. The comments explain the code in more depth as well. </p>

			<h3> Interactive map (contact.js) </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Adrian</i><br>This script solely presents the interactive map on contact.html. I have use this page <a href="https://api.mazemap.com/js/v2.0.14/docs/#intro">Mazemap intro</a>
			as a tutorial on how to code it.</p>

			<h3> Interactive calendar (calendar.js) </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Henning</i><br> blabla </p>

			<h3> Song lyrics (songlyrics.js) </h3>
			<p> <i>Handled by: Joakim</i><br> The functionality is described above, for the song page. For specific coding details, see the commentary in the script itself - but for a brief summary: I made a list consisting of each song as an object with its own id, the display title and display lyrics (w/ formatted line-breaks). A for-loop then outputs each song and its lyrics into their own song-box on the page, with the lyrics hidden initially. A for-loop then attaches an eventlistener to each song-box, which simply toggles those specifics lyric's display within each song-box.</p>
