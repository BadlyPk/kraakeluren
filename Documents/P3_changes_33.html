			<h3> Changes to songs.html </h3>
			<p>Instead of having only one lyric-box be visible at a time (with any already open lyric-box closing whenever you opened a new one, as per the design doc), we instead opted to let the user keep several songs open.
			The idea behind this was simply out of practicality; to let Crows have their specific songs open for a given performance, so the can scroll between the ones they need then and there, rather than having to open them each progressively.
			Another small change not specified in design: longer songs will now have their lyrics split into two columns (responsively: this only happens on screens wider than 1000px). The genuine songbook for Kråkeluren is formatted in two columns - it only made sense to do it that way.
			</p>

			<h3> Changes to gallery.html </h3>
			<p> We decided to have the image carousel full width of the browser, since this looks better. We also removed the "next" and "previous" buttons on the side of the images, and the descripton, which gives the carousel a cleaner look. Instead we chose to make the images change on a timer and added small clickable "dots" under the carousel so it is possible for the user to change the images without waiting. For the images below the carousel, we made it possible for the images to have a different height in the columns instead of same sized pictures. This again gives the page a clean and nice look, and we avoid having to size the images up or down in an unnatural way. We also made the description of the smaller images show on hover, another way to make the design cleaner. </p>

			<h3> Changes to shop.html </h3>
			<p> Very few changes have been made to this page. We have followed the plan almost completely, only using the colors of the Kråkeluren instead of the colors used in the example images on P2. However, this is a change we have made on all the pages. </p>

			<h3> Changes to about_styret.html </h3>
			<p> On this page we have followed our initial plan quite closely; we have round images of the board members and their names below. However, we have changed some of the functions of the page. Below the member names, the title of their position in the board are stated and when the user clicks an image, the page will show only that image (rectangular), the name of the crow and a quote or descripton below. The image will be in a right column, while the text is in the left. There is also a close button the user can click to go back to all the images of the board members. </p>

			<h3> Changes to about.html </h3>
			<p> The about Kråkeluren page does not have many changes from the initial plan either. The only thing we added was a description over the big image that is shown on hover. </p>

			<h3> Changes to blog.html </h3>
			<p> Here, we did not change much from the plan. </p>
