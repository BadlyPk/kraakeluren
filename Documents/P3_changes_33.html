			<h3> Changes to songs.html </h3>
			<p>Instead of having only one lyric-box be visible at a time (with any already open lyric-box closing whenever you opened a new one, as per the design doc), we instead opted to let the user keep several songs open.
			The idea behind this was simply out of practicality; to let Crows have their specific songs open for a given performance, so the can scroll between the ones they need then and there, rather than having to open them each progressively.
			Another small change not specified in design: longer songs will now have their lyrics split into two columns (responsively: this only happens on screens wider than 1000px). The genuine songbook for Kråkeluren is formatted in two columns - it only made sense to do it that way.
			</p>

			<h3> Changes to contact.html </h3>
			<p>This page has for the most part followed the plan. Only thing that has been added is a form where you can "Bli en kråke".
				With this follows a form where you can submit your name, telephone number, e-mail adress and a text put in a textbox.
				The social media part has been added as planned and coded as a non-styled list.
			</p>

			<h3> Changes to gallery.html </h3>
			<p> We decided to have the image carousel full width of the browser, since this looks better. We also removed the "next" and "previous" buttons on the side of the images, and the descripton, which gives the carousel a cleaner look. Instead we chose to make the images change on a timer and added small clickable "dots" under the carousel so it is possible for the user to change the images without waiting. For the images below the carousel, we made it possible for the images to have a different height in the columns instead of same sized pictures. This again gives the page a clean and nice look, and we avoid having to size the images up or down in an unnatural way. We also made the description of the smaller images show on hover, another way to make the design cleaner. </p>

			<h3> Changes to shop.html </h3>
			<p> Very few changes have been made to this page. We have followed the plan almost completely, only using the colors of the Kråkeluren instead of the colors used in the example images on P2. However, this is a change we have made on all the pages. </p>

			<h3> Changes to about_styret.html </h3>
			<p> On this page we have followed our initial plan quite closely; we have round images of the board members and their names below. However, we have changed some of the functions of the page. Below the member names, the title of their position in the board are stated and when the user hovers over an image, it changes to a different one. For this functionality we have used JavaScript to avoid too much css, since there are in total nine different images that will change to nine other different images on hover. </p>

			<h3> Changes to about.html </h3>
			<p> The about Kråkeluren page does not have many changes from the initial plan either. The only thing we added was a description over the big image that is shown on hover. </p>

			<h3> Changes to blog.html </h3>
			<p> Here, we did not change much from the plan. </p>

				<h2> Individual changes </h2>

				<h3> Changes to the navbar </h3>
				<p>
					The navbar is a dynamic navbar, which shrinks when the user scrolls down a certain amount of pixels. The whole navbar, with its corresponding logo will shrink to a predetermined size. This is accomplished by using JavaScript. The responsivety of the navbar is made so that when the browser window is less than 900 pixels, the logo disappears, and the menu buttons start to stack in rows on top of each other. The menu buttons are all clickable, and will direct to the corresponding webpage. When on an webpage, the button for the corresponding site the user is on, will be lit up in a blue color, in order to indicate which site is currently active. The buttons will also get a faint gray background when hovered over.
				</p>

				<h3> Changes to the footer </h3>
				<p>
					In the footer there is now 4 buttons; linking to each of their social medias: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat. These buttons are clickable, and will also change color to their respective color schemes when hovered over.
					Below this, there's a small section with our group name on.
