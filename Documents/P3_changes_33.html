			<p>Lorem ipsum blabla
			<h3> Changes to songs.html </h3>
			<p>Instead of having only one lyric-box be visible at a time (with any already open lyric-box closing whenever you opened a new one, as per the design doc), we instead opted to let the user keep several songs open.
			The idea behind this was simply out of practicality; to let Crows have their specific songs open for a given performance, so the can scroll between the ones they need then and there, rather than having to open them each progressively.
			Another small change not specified in design: longer songs will now have their lyrics split into two columns (responsively: this only happens on screens wider than 1000px). The genuine songbook for Kråkeluren is formatted in two columns - it only made sense to do it that way.
