			<h1>P4 Project Testing</h1>
			<h4>Group 33 - Adrian, Cathrine, Henning, Joakim, Martin<br>October 4th, 2020</h4>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2> Administrative details </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Client & website name: Kråkeluren</li>
				<li>Contact person: Ferdinand Tomek Marnburg (leader of Kråkeluren)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2> Testing Document </h2>
			<p> To receive feedback as easily as possible, Cathrine put together a Google Form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKal9Mm76Z4-09Hd8QJ7bTXg5IrUFoh14xUt13KvrKM8I0UQ/viewform?fbclid=IwAR3UFNvxINXqfBBm8-uYJJZKQHuckq9waCmLdZsen-meiAZ-qEpSe7Zb_3I">linked here</a> - however the form was edited and re-sent to our testers after some tweaks based on feedback from the first pass.
				<br> To gauge the demografic, we asked for their age-range and profession (student or working, IT/tech or something else), and device and browser information. We then wanted 1-10 metrics of: overall impression, design, and navigability. Beyond that, we ask for input for possible improvements and other general comments.
				<br><i> Note: some of the numbers in the graphs below are inconsisted/illogical due to formatting reasons (when combining the results from both versions, ask Google); both versions of the form was sent to the same people, and the rations should remain descriptive. </i>
			</p>
			<h2> Tester Audience </h2>
			<img src="img/form_Demographic.png" alt="" style="width:90%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;"/></li>
			<p> As you can tell from the graphs, the forms were mostly sent out to fellow students and thus landed mostly within the target demographic for Kråkeluren - sidenote, the one working in IT is also an IT-lector student. Not all of these are science lector students/Spanskrøret members, though this should not be a huge factor to the feedback's relevance.
			</p>
			<h2> Tester Platforms </h2>
			<img src="img/form_Platforms.png" alt="" style="width:90%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;"/></li>
			<p> While Chrome was clearly the primary testing browser (purely by coincidence), there was a couple live tests on Safari on mobile/iOS. In addition to the form responses from tablets and computer browsers as seen above, there were a couple live tests on mobile on Chrome. The mobile tests were instrumental to iron out responsivity issues for small screens - which was one of the primary changes between the two versions of the form that were sent out.

			<h2> Feedback Response </h2>

			<h1> Self-reflection </h1>
			<p><i>- From Mr. X:</i></p>
			<p><i>- From Joakim:</i><br> Firstly I think the project went very well all-in-all. I'm very grateful we got ahold of Ferdinand as a client (by pure luck, over a conversation at one of Kråkeluren's meetings), as it instantly defined a "direction" for the project. Plus it meant the actual content we had to implement was all there, from their existing platforms (though they've never had their own site before!) and other info we'd receive from Ferdinand directly. I think all that was instrumental in making the project purpose and direction collectively well-defined and uniform to all of us. And besides, they've been super nice to work with!<br>
			Secondly (maybe primarily?) I feel like I've learned firmly how to go about with HTML, CSS and JS (which feels great!). I already knew a fair bit of programming though I've never touched JavaScript, but I feel like I quickly got a grasp of the syntax and general problem-solving with it. I guess the real personal take-away from the project itself has been the work related to coordinating different branches of a project (as the only actual Kråke in our group), and why it's important to get right. </p>
