			<h2> Administrative details </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Client & website name: Kråkeluren</li>
				<li>Contact person: Ferdinand Tomek Marnburg</li>
			</ul>

			<h2> Purpose, goals and audience </h2>
			<p>The purpose of the website is to display Kråkeluren as a great choice for
				new students of Spanskrøret who wants to engage in some social group while
				studying at NTNU. We wish to create a welcoming and fun website that presents
				Kråkeluren as an exciting and welcoming group.<br/>
				While the website will be approachable to anyone curious about them, the main
				target audience are male members of the student organization Spanskrøret who's
				considering joining the troupe.
			</p>

			<h2> Navigation structure </h2>
			<p>	We want the website to have a straightforward, easily readable appearance
				(more on this in the next section). Navigation on the site should be visually
				intuitive with a persistent nav-bar at the top from which the user can access
				every single page, from any page, in addition to the logo and title placed
				above the nav bar, which leads to the front-page when clicked on. The number
				of pages is manageable enough that they can each inhabit this nav-bar without
				cluttering it (though splicing a couple of the pages together is not out of
				the question - more on that under "Content").

				<figcaption style="text-align:center"> Click to open in new tab </figcaption>

			<h2> Page layout and appearance </h2>
			<p> Firstly: Aesthetic. We want to use a somewhat minimalistic style, using
				the colours of Kråkeluren's logo as much as possible to create visual consistency;
				black, slightly dark grey and an off-white. This could be combined a number of
				different ways (off-white text on black buttons, black text on off-white background,
				dark-grey section outlines, etc.), allowing us to distribute some visual interest
				as well.<br/>
				Second: Layout. As mentioned above, we want a persistent navigation bar, with the
				logo on the left (and perhaps social media quick-links, situated to the right)
				just above. When the user is at the top of the screen, this part should draw
				some attention, while after scrolling a couple inches (abstract amount for the time
				being), the logo should shrink down and the nav-bar become thinner, to occupy less
				space while maintaining navigation no matter where the user is on-screen.
