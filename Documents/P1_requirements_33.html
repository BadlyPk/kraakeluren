			<h1>P1 Project Requirements</h1>
			<h4>Group 33 - Adrian, Cathrine, Henning, Joakim, Martin</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="admin_details">
			<h2> Administrative details </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Client: Kråkeluren</li>
				<li>Contact: Ferdinand Tomek Marnburg</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our client is Ferdinand, the manager (so-called "Crow-Father") of
				Kråkeluren. Kråkeluren is the "official, unofficial" male chorus of
				Spanskrøret, the student organization for science lector studies.
				Ferdinand leads the management board of the troupe, and will be our
				primary middle-man between the Kråkelur board and our group as we develop
				their site.</p>

		<div>
			<h2> Purpose and goals </h2>
			<p> The purpose of the website is to display Kråkeluren as a great choice
				for new students of Spanskrøret who wants to engage in some social group
				while studying at NTNU. We wish to create a welcoming and fun website
				that presents Kråkeluren as an exciting and welcoming group. </p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2> Audience </h2>
			<p> While the website will be approachable to anyone curious about them,
				the main target audience are male members of the student organization
				Spanskrøret who's considering joining the troupe. Especially guys who
				wants to take a break from studying and enjoy good and very vocal
				company. Candidates are not restricted to guys who are well experienced
				with singing in a choir either: literally the only requirement they claim
				is "you must be able to make noise!"</p>

			<h2> Functional and Non-Functional Requirements </h2>
			<p>Functional</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The website shall provide a good first impression about Kråkeluren's concept, showing off their "culture", traditions and what they're up to currently (though baring in mind it will be a static website initially, as part of the project).</li>
				<li>The website shall illustrate Kråkeluren's role within Spanskrøret and other concrete info such as song lists, board members, etc.</li>
				<li>The website shall display Kråke-merchandise and inform users of where to get them (no in-site purchases).</li>
		</ul>
			<p>Non-Functional</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Users should be able to access the navigation menu from anywhere on the site (incl. at any level of scrolling).</li>
				<li>Users should be able to move between different pages with as few clicks as possible (hover to open navigation, avoid need to return to the front page to find something else).</li>
				<li>The presentation should have a consistent over-arching theme, based on their culture, humour, colour-scheme (based on the logo) and similar elements.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2> Final location </h2>
			<p>A friend and fellow crow of Joakim runs website hosting as part of a
			business, so the website will most likely end up with them as "kråkeluren.no".</p>
